2048 Game and AI, written in Haskell

2048 Original:

Full alpha-beta pruning with the expectiminimax algorithm, which can currently run until depth 20 with no real issues. Current work is focused on making good heuristics (and also efficient heuristics).



2048-3D Game and AI:

It's pretty straightforward, nothing too amazing. You can use naive minimax with no pruning at a very low depth, because it turns out the game is fairly easy to solve. The current program will always win :)
